# Invoice-Extractor-app

The **Invoice Extractor App** is a web-based tool that lets you upload an invoice image and instantly extracts:
- ðŸ†” **Invoice Number**
- ðŸ“… **Invoice Date**
- ðŸ’° **Total Amount**

It runs entirely in your browser using a **Gradio interface** â€” no complex setup needed. Just upload your file, and the results appear in seconds.

## ðŸŒŸ Why Use This App?
Manually searching through invoices is slow and error-prone.  
This app:
- Automatically reads invoice text using **EasyOCR**  
- Detects key fields by matching invoice label patterns  
- Cleans and formats the extracted values  
- Works on scanned PDFs converted to images or photographed invoices

## ðŸ–¥ How It Works (with Gradio)
1. **Upload Invoice** â€” Drag & drop or select an image from your computer.  
2. **OCR Processing** â€” The app converts the image to grayscale, applies adaptive thresholding, and uses **EasyOCR** to detect text.  
3. **Label Search** â€” The system looks for keywords like "Invoice No", "Date", "Total".  
4. **Value Extraction** â€” Finds and cleans the value near each label.  
5. **Display Results** â€” The extracted fields appear in **JSON format** directly in the browser.
